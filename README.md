## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am the manager of Software Engineering at [Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu/) where I manage a team of developers who work on full-stack web application solutions for the university. I also manage a [Student Software Engineering Program](https://www.ohio.edu/oit/career-opportunities/student-employment/student-programs/ssep) (SSEP) that provides an experiential learning opportunity for Computer Science students in the [Russ College of Engineering and Technology](https://www.ohio.edu/engineering/).
